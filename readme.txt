Welcome to nFighter - The fourth in hopefully a long series of Lua games for the TI-nSpire

How to Play the Game:
~Controls:
	~Use the arrow keys to move your ship and to aim at the enemies.
		-Pressing and holding the arrow keys will allow one to move multiple times (Note: There is a slight pause between pressing and holding and the crosshairs moving - This is a limitation of the nspire platform and not the game itself)
	~Use the 'esc' key to shoot
	~Hit 'r' if you would like to restart.
	~Advanced Controls
		~If you don't like using the arrow keys you can use the num pad instead.
		~ 8 to go up
		~ 2 to go down
		~ 4 to go left
		~ 6 to go right
		~ 5 to shoot
~Points:
	~Points are shown in the upper left hand corner during gameplay.
	~100pts for destroying an enemy ship
	~50pts for a shield crate - A shield will appear around you crosshairs and when the enemies 
		shoot you will only recieve half damage insead of full. One fuel crate will protect 
		you from two enemy shots
	~20pts for shooting a life crate as well as an extra life, or if you alrady have nine lives 
		(A life is a heart at the bottom of the dash), a full health bar.
	~10pts for shooting a bullets crate as well as 5 more bullets
	~10pts for shooting a fuel crate as well as a full refuel. 0.5 fuel is used everytime your
		ship moves so make sure that you stay ontop of the fuel gauge!
~A few Notes
	~You lose 1 bullet everytime you shoot (duh!)
	~You lose 0.5 off your fuel everytime you move
	~You lose hp everytime you get shot. In the first level this is 20hp. In higher levels, as the
		enemy becomes stronger, this will become more.
~A Note on Death
	~You can die in one of 3 gruesome ways.
	~Running out of bullets will lead to death
	~Running out of fuel will lead to death
	~And finally losing all of your lives will result in your termination...

Cheers & Have Fun
